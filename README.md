## Part 1: FOUNDATIONS OF TENSORFLOW 2 AND DEEP LEARNING

**Foundations of TensorFlow 2 and Deep Learning** in TensorFlow in Action by Thushan Ganegedera, introduces the essential concepts and tools needed to build a strong understanding of TensorFlow 2 and its role in deep learning. It begins by explaining the fundamentals of machine learning and neural networks before delving into the TensorFlow 2 framework, highlighting its eager execution mode, Keras API integration, and data pipeline capabilities. The section focuses on helping readers grasp how TensorFlow structures computation through tensors and computational graphs, how to prepare and manage data efficiently, and how to construct, train, and evaluate simple models. Overall, it lays the groundwork for more advanced topics by blending theory with practical coding examples that build familiarity with TensorFlow’s workflow and ecosystem.

## Part 2 : LOOK MA, NO HANDS! DEEP NETWORKS IN THE REAL WORLD

**Look Ma, No Hands! Deep Networks in the Real World** ,in TensorFlow in Action by Thushan Ganegedera, moves from foundational concepts to practical, real-world applications of deep learning using TensorFlow 2. This section explores how deep neural networks can be applied to complex tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. It guides readers through building and training more advanced models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while emphasizing model optimization, regularization, and performance evaluation. The chapters highlight not only how to construct and tune these models but also how to deploy them effectively in realistic scenarios. Overall, Part 2 bridges theory and practice, demonstrating how deep learning techniques can automate sophisticated tasks that traditionally required human intelligence.
